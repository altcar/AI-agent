bs4 just static scrrenshot


modify it """go to https://www.instagram.com/shalevfrfr/saved/all-posts/, login with sessionid "sk-dummyapikey", and find my saved posts, goto each post, click unsave bookmark button, then click save bookmark button again to re-save, repeat for all saved posts"""



i want ai agent (browser-use or agenttars) to write me a python code using patchright and test if the unsave save mechanism is working. not asking ai agent to do it because i have tons of saved post that will cost me a lot, instead,



however, the saving and unsave mechanism not working (due to the button property changed?



ok now it runs perfectly, but sometimes, instagram.com just bugged so that the post isnt saved again, to avoid losting data, can you open the post again and see if the post saved.



the scrolling timeout error
